# Equivalence of Well-Ordering Principle, Zorn's Lemma, and Axiom of Choice
This repository provides a comprehensive proof of the equivalence between three fundamental concepts in set theory: the Well-Ordering Principle, Zorn's Lemma, and the Axiom of Choice. The project is aimed at students and researchers interested in understanding these foundational principles and their interconnections.

## Contents
- **Proof of Equivalence**: Detailed proofs demonstrating how each of these principles implies the others.
- **Theoretical Background**: Explanations and discussions on the significance and applications of each principle.
- **Examples and Exercises**: Practical examples and exercises to illustrate the concepts and help reinforce understanding.

## Goals
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as a learning tool for those studying set theory and related fields.
- **Research Reference**: Provide a reliable reference for researchers working on related topics.

## How to Use
- **Clone the Repository**: Use git clone to download the repository.
- **Explore the Content**: Navigate through the directories to find proofs, explanations, and examples.
- **Contribute**: Feel free to contribute by adding more examples, improving existing proofs, or expanding the theoretical discussions.

We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for both learning and research. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
